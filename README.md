Welding 101 is a XR training simulation that offers a safe, cost-effective way to learn welding techniques with real-time AI feedback. It integrates metallurgy education and covers all major welding methods. The project aims to enhance hands-on learning and plans to implement teleoperation for remote welding control through virtual reality.
